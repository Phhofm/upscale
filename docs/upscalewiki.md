# Upscale Wiki Model Database

There are a lot of custom trained models on the [Upscale Wiki Model Database](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database) that can be used for upscaling. Most of these Models use the ESRGAN architecture and can therefore be used with [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer).

When I first started upscaling I came across this site and was overwhelmed by the amount of models. While there is a textual description, I wanted to see the visual outputs/difference (so visually, not textually). This is why I has started this page. I thought I would now start on working to provide an example per category as they are listed in the wiki (also since I had started using models not listed there like for example on the Deblurring page the DeblurGANv2, MAXIM, NAFNet models etc so we can separate). Since the upscale wiki model database website should change/get updated from time to time these examples might not always be perfectly up-to-date/miss some models.
