# List of Models used
Since I generally use the model name as the output file names in the examples on this page, this list is automatically generated by extracting the base file names out of the examples and adding only unique items to this sorted list. This way this page updates itself with each new build / commit / update on an example with a new model.

<ul id="example-1">
  <li v-for="model in models" :key="model">
    {{ model }}
  </li>
</ul>
