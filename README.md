## Story
My interest in upscaling started when I generated images with Midjourney AI and thought about enlarging those so I could use one as a desktop background image.
I started using the [chaiNNer application](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer "chaiNNer application") and therefore looking for models. At first I just used the UltraSharp model but after I while I got curious how it compared to other models.
So i tested the Universal Models, which led me to make a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/0TYRDmQ5LZk "youtube video") so others that were interested too could visually compare for themselves.
Then I thought upon expanding to some more models, which led me to make [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/yaxs13/image_upscaling_models_compared_general_photo_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
Which then led me to make a test with models from the art category plus more universal models for the people in the stablediffusion channel, so I created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/yev37i/comparison_of_upscaling_models_for_ai_generated/ "this post").
And since I tested out more and more and it led to more and more examples, I decided to create this website about it so I have all the examples in one place.
## Purpose
The purpose of this website is for people to visually compare for themselves the resulting output of different upscaling models, mostly because beauty is in the eye of the beholder, meaning different people might favor different models. This will allow them to use the model they like best for upscaling their own images.
