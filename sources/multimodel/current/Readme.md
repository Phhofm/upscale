# Multimodel Current

These are the upscaled output files that are used for the comparison examples on the multimodel page. This allows me to more easily update the examples on the page (for example adding new model outputs).

These images are all in the mozjpeg format as to reduce file size because of imgsli upload limit (big examples).

If you take the input images from sources/input to compare these upscaling results with your own upscaling model / result, make sure to also export or then convert your results to jpg and then to use mozpjeg compression on them, just to compare apples with apples (and not a lossless image file type with a lossy image file type).
