# Favorites Source Files

I provide here the source files for the favorites page.
The input folder contains the image as used for the upscaling examples.
The output folder contains the respective upscaled outputs of each of these input images as displayed on the favorites page.

I provided these sources for you to compare these examples for yourself with your favorite upscaling model or application.
Just upscale an image from the input folder. Make sure to have set your output options to the .JPG file format, or then convert them to .jpg after upscaling, before comparing to these example outputs as found in the output folder.
Only compare .jpg files with .jpg files! (and not against .png output)

Hope this helps :)
